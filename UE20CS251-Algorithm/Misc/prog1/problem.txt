Puzzels : 

1. there are 12 marbles,One of them are heavier or lighter. You can use the balance it at most 3.
   Find the odd marble.
2.Find the hypoteneuse: hypo = root(adj^2+base^2)
  But a better algorithms : hypo = 7a/8 + b/2, IF a>b.
3.Tap A fills a tank in 2hrs, Tap B fills the tank in 3 hrs, If the fill the same tank
  Simultaneously, how much time would they take.
  [Stupidly aweseme solution, take lcm of 2 and 3 : 6]
  in 6 hrs, we can fill 3 tanks with A
  in 6, we can fill 2 tanks with B
  6hrs -> 5tanks [Using both taps]
  ? -> 1tank
  ? = 1*6/5
