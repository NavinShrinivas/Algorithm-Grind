# Algorithms introduction.

Session-1, Algorithm is mostly about thinking. In this course we spend majority of our time 
analyzinb algorithms.If online classes, screenshots are filled in repectives units with session
details.



# Puzzels : 

These aren't exaclty part of the course, but a nice excersise for again, you guessed it..Thinking.

- there are 12 marbles,One of them are heavier or lighter. You can use the balance it at most 3.
   Find the odd marble.
- Find the hypoteneuse: hypo = root(adj^2+base^2)
  But a better algorithms : hypo = 7a/8 + b/2, IF a>b.
- Tap A fills a tank in 2hrs, Tap B fills the tank in 3 hrs, If the fill the same tank
  Simultaneously, how much time would they take.
  [Stupidly aweseme solution, take lcm of 2 and 3 : 6]
  in 6 hrs, we can fill 3 tanks with A
  in 6, we can fill 2 tanks with B
  6hrs -> 5tanks [Using both taps]
  ? -> 1tank
  ? = 1*6/5
