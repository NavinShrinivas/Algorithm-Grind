+# Algorithm-Grind
+
+
+hello wodl
+
+Repo mainly containing https://cses.fi and CodeForces problems along
+with some of my own explaintations and notes for each module.
+I even use clrs for few algorithms
+
+This repo aims to be your go to place for learning a algorithms and also
+practice a decent amount of problems for each module
+
+Algorithms are written in C++
+problems are solved in both C and C++
+
+
+Module-1 this is another liner :
